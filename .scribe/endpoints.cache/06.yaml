        This method allows the authenticated user to refer a candidate for a job.
        If the candidate already exists in the database, the method checks if the candidate
        has already been referred by the authenticated user. If the candidate has not been
        referred, a new referral point is created. If the candidate does not exist in the database,
        a new candidate is created and then referred.
